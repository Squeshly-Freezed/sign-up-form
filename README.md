My thoughts on the project:

I've gone off the beaten path, and have been very creative with this project - diverging drastically from
most other students' work. Didn't spend too much time on this one, but it's pretty cool. I am happy with
how I've implemented the couple of JavaScript functions and think the code is quite clean.
